# Mars Images Page

Mars is an Earth-like planet that has been a topic of much interest for humanity.
In 2004, NASA launched the rovers Spirit and Opportunity to Mars, followed by Curiosity in 2011.

This project is a responsive, single-page website that allows users to see real images taken on Mars,
as taken by the rovers. The user can choose the rover and specify which rover's camera to use, 
and select the date either in Earth-time or Mars-time, i.e. Sol.
After validating the user's input, the page sends an API request to NASA's REST API server, and upon
receiving the response with the images, displays them organized to the user.

The user can save their favorite images and then display them in a carousel slide.
